I'm a post-doctoral researcher in the [Data Science Group](https://datascience.deib.polimi.it/) in Politecnico di Milano, Italy, investigating the effects of the propagation of disinformation on the spread of epidemics, with agent-based models at the urban scale. 

I've completed my PhD in Politecnico di Torino in the [Statistical Physics group](https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/cmpcs/statistical_physics_and_interdisciplinary_applications). During my PhD, I focused on the application of statistical physics methods to epidemic inference, with the goal of controlling and containing epidemic outbreaks.


My research interests lie in complex networks, statistical physics, data science and AI.
I am also interested in computer science and open source software. I've been involved in the development of the Android app [Libre BusTO](https://gitpull.it/w/librebusto/en/), adding new features and fixing bugs since 2016.
