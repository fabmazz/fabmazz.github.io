Former PhD Student at Politecnico di Torino (defended PhD thesis in July 2023) in the [Statistical Physics group](https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/cmpcs/statistical_physics_and_interdisciplinary_applications) in the Dipartimento di Scienze Applicate e Tecnologia (DISAT). My research interests lie in between complex networks, statistical physics, data science and AI. 

During my PhD, I focused on applying statistical physics to epidemic inference, and in particular in controlling epidemic outbreaks with probabilistic methods.

I am also interested in computer science, and open source software. I've been involved in the development of the Android app [Libre BusTO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.reyboz.bustorino), adding new features and fixing bugs since 2016.
